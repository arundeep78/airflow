# Airflow on K8s (Kind) image using official Helm chart

This documentation is based on [offical documentation from airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/quick-start.html). At the time of writing Helm chart version was 1.4.0.

NOTE: This procecude is based on [Kind installation of K8s](https://github.com/arundeep78/wsl_debian_dev/blob/master/Kind_k8s_Readme.md). If you do have the WSL image are prepared in that document some extra steps might be required based on our specific situation.

## Create a directory structure for airflow project

Create a directories for airflow project. These directories store configuration files for Helm chart for airflow, any image files that it might need, test DAGs etc. These files can be uploaded to github as needed.

You will follow your own project organization methods. This one I just throught might work for me. We shall see  :)

```zsh
# for main airflow project
mkdir ~/projects/airflow 
# to keep kind k8s cluster related config files
mkdir ~/projects/airflow/kind 
# to keep airflow helm chart deplyment/installation related files
mkdir ~/projects/airflow/helmcharts 

# Enter in the main project directory and start code for documentations.
# You would use any other tool that you might like for coding/documentation
cd ~/projects/airflow
code .
```

## Create a config.yaml file for kind cluster

Create a config.yaml file to creare a kind cluster. This cluster will be used to deploy Airflow using Helm chart.

`./kind/config.yaml`

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
name: kind-airflow
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  image: kindest/node:v1.20.7@sha256:cbeaf907fc78ac97ce7b625e4bf0de16e3ea725daf6b04f930bd14c
67c671ff9
- role: worker
  image: kindest/node:v1.20.7@sha256:cbeaf907fc78ac97ce7b625e4bf0de16e3ea725daf6b04f930bd14c
67c671ff9
```

**NOTE**: I used 1.20 image specifically as in my case 1.21 image was failing for some reason.

## Create kind cluster using this config.yaml

```zsh
kind create cluster --config=./kind/config.yaml                                              ‚îÄ‚ïØ

Set kubectl context to "kind-kind-airflow"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind-airflow
```

A simple check as proposed above in the output shows

```zsh
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind-airflow                                      ‚îÄ‚ïØ
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:46493
KubeDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:46493/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```

## Create a namespace in the cluster for airflow installation

```zsh
export NS=ns-airflow
kubectl create namespace $NS
```

OR create a [namespace file](kind/namespace.yaml) and execute

```zsh
kubectl apply -f ./kind/namespace.yaml
```

## Add apache airflow helm repository

```zsh
helm repo add apache-airflow https://airflow.apache.org
helm repo update
```

NOTE: apache-airflow is just local name given to the long URL of the repository.

If you want to see all the config files in the airflow Helm chart then execute below command

```zsh
cd ./helmcharts
helm pull apache-airflow/airflow --untar
```

The above command pulls a specific Chart from the given repository; in this case airflow.

## Install the chart with default configuration

use the local copy of the chart

```zsh
export RELEASE_NAME=rn-airflow
helm install $RELEASE_NAME . --namespace $NS
```

OR

use directly from the repository url

```zsh
export RELEASE_NAME=rn-airflow
helm install $RELEASE_NAME apache-airflow/airflow --namespace $NS
```
